                Product development also plays a key role in the strategies of
                leading companies worldwide. Besides the aspects relating to the
                increase of efficiency within the manufacturing process, cost
                reduction and market expansion, product features that focus on
                consumer convenience and sustainability lay in the centre of
                product development. While most companies concentrate on one or
                two of these aspects to ensure that the product features are not
                overstrained, innovation leaders strive for reaching them all at
                the same time.

                An important contribution to recyclability of food packaging and
                thus sustainability is the silicone-free valve for ketchup,
                mayonnaises and spreadables. Most bottles are equipped with
                hinge-caps that are easy to reclose. About 40% of these closures
                have an additional valve that allows precise and convenient
                dosing.

                But the challenge faced is that most valves currently in use for
                ketchup, mayonnaise and spreadables are made of silicone, which
                contaminates the PET and/or the HDPE/PP recycling stream. Thus,
                more and more countries are taking action to remove silicon out
                of the recycling stream.

                To avoid contamination, Kin Industrie offers Kin Industries Non
                Spillage Valve(NSV), a silicon-free advancement of the proven
                silicon valves. It possesses the same characteristics, but is
                made of environmentally clean TPE, a polyolefin that recycles
                with the HDPE and PP recycling stream without contaminating it.
